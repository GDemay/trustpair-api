# REST API with Flask

Itâ€™s a restaurant API where you can create, update and delete a restaurant (identified by its name), and also list restaurants, get a restaurant by name and get a random
restaurant.

## Test

To test the API calls of this project, I decided to use Pytest.

To test the project:

```
pytest test/test_flask.py 
```
Output:
```
